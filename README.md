# deep-diff

What is the usecase for this?

- to show differences in data changes (current and past data)
- useful to show the changes in value before approval (aka git on the browser)
- could be useful for bulk update, where the differences aka patch can be shown to users before approval (e.g. changes in price, changes in product description)
